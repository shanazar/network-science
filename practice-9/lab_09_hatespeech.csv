I believe your ECU will be fine with that generation of F22s. Just be wary you'll still have the 9k redline, but F22s didn't have that stock. Some owners have said they've hit it with their swaps and have been ok, but that's your call to make.

The engine and tranny should work fine, but the ap1 tranny was geared lower. Just drivability differences.

t1_div0tef,"&gt;o que me faz confusão visto que lá fora nigger é visto como um insulto

palavras parecidas com a mesma origem podem ter sentidos, conotações diferentes em línguas diferentes. Exemplo o derrogatório do título desta thread, que não quer dizer o que o OP quer dizer.

negro é a palavra preferida no Brasil e em certos meios. Nos Estados Unidos consideram a melancia um estereótipo racista (acerca de negros, não é acerca de gregos ou portugueses!). Black face é uma coisa terrível nos EUA porque têm historial de ser usado para propósitos de entretenimento racistas.

A palavra negro, da cor, não é por si só racista. A melancia também não. é tudo contexto cultural.

Jeff would tease her and she would fire right back at him. In Pascal's Triangle Revisited (the Tranny Queen episode) when she and Slater were fighting over Jeff, she was equally matched with Slater in her put downs . Current Britta, I feel, would sort of stumble on her own  words and the joke would end up being how she messed up her comeback.  Like you said, ditzy.

Run some acetone through it to make sure it's free of any contaminating oil, grease, etc. Then, plumb it in-line with the wort chiller. Run your garden hose to the tranny cooler and then to the wort chiller. Put the tranny cooler inside an ice chest with plenty of ice water with a lot of salt.

t1_crej9wh,"&gt; Whats up with that being a preference car for gay guys?

Maybe because they're less likely to have kids, so they don't need the backseat, and they're not trying to impress people with useless HP?

I haven't had a miata yet, but the 2016 model is quite tempting. I've had similar cars though, and a manual transmission, rear wheel drive, two seat roaster is a blast - an absolute blast to drive. I've had much faster cars. I've even had another convertible. But I've never had more fun than when I had a manual tranny BMW Z3.

Anything that you change that leaves that formula is less fun, in my opinion. I kept a buddy's front wheel drive mini when he was deployed - not the same. I had a big powerful mercedes SL, but it was an automatic - not the same.

t1_eaoftgl,"With enough money it's possible, but you said it's your daily and you're a college student.  I'd just keep the car the way it is, sell it when you have some cash saved up and buy a VR4.

The big reason I say this is there is SO MUCH more to the VR4 than just the engine.  If you do manage to get a 6g72tt and drop it in, you'll still have a 5 speed tranny that most likely wont be able to handle the torque.  

You wont have AWD, nor All Wheel Steering, no big brakes, no active aero, no ECS, no active exhaust, etc.  All the things, IMO, that make the VR4 unique and fun to drive, you wont have.

Basically, like it's been said below, you'll need to basically go buy a VR4 as a ""parts car"" to put into your 97 SOHC, which why wouldn't you just invest the money into fixing up the VR4.

One would get a new oilpan if it is rusty or some even replace it when the gasket goes because, hey, why not, you are under there.  

No, hitting something with your underside does not say that your tranny is hit with something.  If you have a leaky gasket, you replace them.

Why?

First, it's actually easier.  The whole generator/engine assembly can be bought off the shelf.  And you don't need a tranny with an electric motor - it has full torque from 0 RPM.

Second, a diesel motor has a narrow powerband, but within a very narrow RPM window it is in it's ""happy place"" where fuel economy is awesome - that's why they make killer genset motors.

I went in with my car that had maybe 50k miles on it and I had just had my entire transmission serviced literally 2 days before. After they changed my oil they said my transmission is looking dirty and they offer a $120 tranny flush service. I simply said 

""Oh cool that's good to know. The guys that did it Monday charged $130""

t1_e3zcgw3,"I'm in the UK and I remember going to donate blood for the first time when I was 18. I filled out the questionnaire where it asked if I'd had sex with a man and I was like sure. I thought that because if always used protection it wouldn't be a problem, but no, because I'd touched a dick within the past 12 months they didn't want my filthy faggot blood. 

The nurse literally told me that a woman could have unprotected sex with a stranger (I think? Something along those lines) just before donating blood and no one would bat an eye.",TrippingOnAlkali,faggot,0

t1_dvv8tse,"I'm glad a tran in here finally said they hate drag. This topic totally doesn't get posted once a week in a tranny sub, so this is really refreshing to see.

Cis men are the only ones who do drag and they do it specifically to mock me as a man in a dress. And people think this is okay? It's current year folks, get with the times! It's transphobic as fuck. ",JLink20,tranny,0
